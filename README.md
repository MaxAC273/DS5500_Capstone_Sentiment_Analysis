# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data: Exploring Abortion Discourse

Authors: Alan Cheung and Bezawit Ayalew

## Introduction

In this project, we delve into sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset centered around discussions regarding abortion. Our goal is to utilize Python and various natural language processing (NLP) techniques to examine the sentiment expressed in tweets related to abortion. By analyzing and classifying the sentiment of these tweets, we aim to uncover insights into public opinion and attitudes surrounding this sensitive topic.
